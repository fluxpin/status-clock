A status bar clock for xmonad and other stand-alone window managers. It
takes a time format string (see the man pages for strftime and date) as an
argument and prints the time to standard output every minute.

Output is synchronized with the turning of the minute rather than occurring
strictly every sixty seconds.

Note that the format string is not validated (it would be easier to safely
reimplement strftime). Malicious or unusual input may result in undefined
behavior.

**Building**

You probably need glibc to build this (see util.c for details).

The program can be built (and installed) with the included Makefile. It
supports DESTDIR/PREFIX installation.
